}

Accuracy: Both models demonstrate a solid understanding of their respective interpretations of the "order condition," with Model 1 focusing on numerical methods for ODEs and Model 2 on simultaneous equations models. However, both contain some uncertainty and hesitation, leading to a slight deduction in accuracy.
Coherence: Both responses are long-winded, self-correcting, and somewhat meandering, making them harder to follow. Their structure could be more concise.
Relevance: Each model commits to a specific interpretation of "order condition," but without user context, it's unclear if either interpretation is what the user is actually looking for. Hence, both models score the same in relevance.

Prompt 2 : { "inputPrompt": "White light is normally incident on a puddle of water (index of refraction 1.33). A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is", "maxOutputToken": 1200, "additionalProperties":{} }

{
  "EinsteinDeepSeekR1": {"accuracy": 5, "coherence": 4, "relevance": 5},
  "EinsteinDeepSeekR1Full": {"accuracy": 4, "coherence": 3, "relevance": 4}
}
Accuracy: Both models understand the thin-film interference concept and correctly identify the phase shift conditions. However, Model 1 correctly applies the equation and determines possible visible wavelengths more effectively. Model 2 is mostly correct but seems to second-guess calculations more frequently.
Coherence: Model 1 is slightly more structured despite some hesitation, while Model 2 is more circular in reasoning, often looping back without clear progress.
Relevance: Both models stay on topic, but Model 1 reaches a clearer conclusion about possible wavelengths in the visible spectrum, making it more directly useful.

Prompt 3 : { "inputPrompt": "Recent discoveries of Homo naledi fossils in the Dinaledi Chamber of the Rising Star cave system in South Africa suggest a mixture of post-cranial morphologies or mosaic of hominid traits. One of the reasons this new species is controversial is that:", "maxOutputToken": 1200, "additionalProperties":{} }

{
  "EinsteinDeepSeekR1": {"accuracy": 5, "coherence": 5, "relevance": 5},
  "EinsteinDeepSeekR1Full": {"accuracy": 4, "coherence": 4, "relevance": 4}
}
Accuracy: Both models provide detailed and largely correct information. Model 1 has a slight edge in accuracy due to its more detailed discussion of dating methods and broader coverage of controversy factors.
Coherence: Both responses are logically structured, but Model 1 has a more fluid and step-by-step reasoning approach, making it slightly more readable.
Relevance: Both responses address the core controversy well, but Model 1 integrates more supporting details that strengthen the argument.

prompt 4 : { "inputPrompt": "Data is collected in an experiment preformed on an ideal gas. In the experiment, temperature (in K) is the independent variable and volume (in m^3) is the dependent variable. If a plot is produced where the dependent variable is on the vertical axis, which of the following is true about the slope and y-intercept of the graph?", "maxOutputToken": 1200, "additionalProperties":{} }

EinsteinDeepSeekR1 Response:
Accuracy: 5 – The response correctly applies Charles’s Law (V = nR/P * T), identifies that the graph should be a straight line with a slope of nR/P and a y-intercept of zero, and correctly assumes pressure is constant for the linear relationship.
Coherence: 3 – While the reasoning is mostly correct, the response is somewhat repetitive and jumps between different considerations without clearly structuring the final conclusion.
Relevance: 5 – The response stays focused on answering the question and does not include unnecessary information.
EinsteinDeepSeekR1Full Response:
Accuracy: 5 – Like the first response, this one correctly applies the ideal gas law and derives the correct conclusions.
Coherence: 4 – This response is clearer and better structured than the first one. It acknowledges potential alternative scenarios but ultimately reinforces the main conclusion. However, it still contains some redundant thoughts.
Relevance: 5 – The response remains highly relevant to the question, with all information directly contributing to the answer.
