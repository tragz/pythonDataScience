Tokenization of strings


## Installation

#### Add Virtual Environment
```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install ntlk with pip

```bash
    pip install -U nltk
    pip install transformers
```
    
## Documentation

#### Why do we need to tokenize strings?
- break down complex text into manageable units
- present text in format easire to analyze or perfom operation
- specific linguistic task, part-of-speech tagging, syntatic parsing, NER
- NLP application and create structured training data

#### What are these tokens used for?
- Feature extraction - frequency, part-of-speech tags, poistion in sentence etc. In sentiment analysis the presence of certain tokens might be strongly indicative of +ve/-ve sentiment
- Vectorization - NLP tasks tokens are converted to numerical vectors using techniquest like Bag of Words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Sequence Modeling - translation, text generation tokens are used in sequence models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) or Transformers. Predict sequences of tokens understand the context and likelihood of token occurences
- Training the Model 
- Context Understanding

#### Why use such different and more complicated tokenization methods?
- tokens are more intricate representations of language than complete words
- address a large range of vocabulary
- smaller subunits is computationally more efficient
- help better contextual understanding
- more adaptable across languages that can be quite different from English
