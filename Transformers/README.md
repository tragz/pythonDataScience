### Documentation

#### Why should I use transformers?
1. Easy-to-use state-of-the-art models:

    1. High performance on natural language understanding & generation, computer vision, and audio tasks. 
   2. Low barrier to entry for educators and practitioners. 
   3. Few user-facing abstractions with just three classes to learn. 
   4. A unified API for using all our pretrained models.
2. Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:
    1. Researchers can share trained models instead of always retraining. 
   2. Practitioners can reduce compute time and production costs. 
   3. Dozens of architectures with over 400,000 pretrained models across all modalities. 
3. Choose the right framework for every part of a model's lifetime:
    1. Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code. 
   2. Move a single model between TF2.0/PyTorch/JAX frameworks at will. 
   3. Seamlessly pick the right framework for training, evaluation, and production.
4. Easily customize a model or an example to your needs:
    1. We provide examples for each architecture to reproduce the results published by its original authors. 
   2. Model internals are exposed as consistently as possible. 
   3. Model files can be used independently of the library for quick experiments.
